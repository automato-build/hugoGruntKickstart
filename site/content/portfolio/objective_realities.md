How does it feel to be an object in a future smart home?

As things become smarter and connected, their roles in people's lives are challenged. Things become closer and closer to us, eventually becoming "users" themselves.
When designing for a future of smarter and more connected things, we need to understand objects needs and perspective and potentially design for them.

Objective realities is a way to experience everyday life from the perspective of things.
By switching your point of view to a fan, a plug or a cleaning robot, one will be able to act on the environment around and listen to the invisible chatter that happens between connected devices and the home.
