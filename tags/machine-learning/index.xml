      <description>We think of smart/learning objects as yet not finished entities that can evolve their behaviors by observing, reading and interpreting our habits. They train their algorithms based on deep learning or similar ways to constantly adapt and refine their decisions.
But what if things are not that good at learning after all without some help?
What if in a near future, i could just get a person to train my products better as i do with pets?</description>
