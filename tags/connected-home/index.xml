      <description>How does it feel to be an object in a smart home?
As things become smarter and connected, their roles in people&amp;rsquo;s lives are challenged. Things become closer and closer to us, eventually becoming &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo; themselves. How will we understand objects&amp;rsquo; needs and perspectives and potentially design for them?
While designers and companies that deal with smartness and artificial intelligence try merge the gap between human and objects by designing objects and machines that resemble more humans in their form and interaction, we decided to take the opposite approach and create an experience for &amp;lsquo;humans&amp;rsquo; to get closer to feeling and acting like objects.</description>

      <title>The White Box</title>

      <description>The white Box is a new concept for a home control system that would be “transparently smart” to its user. In collaboration with Casa Jasmina, the first open-source smart home, we asked ourselves how “smart” can a home be? What kind of smartness are we talking about? Is technology in service of the user or is it becoming the controller of the user?
If you want to make your home “smart”, most solutions in the market come in form of a black box that takes care of everything for you.</description>
