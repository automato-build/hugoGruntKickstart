      <description>The fast spreading and ease of access to Machine Learning and Cloud computing has brought to a boom of experiments and excitement around our ability to build machines that make sense, learn, measure and predict the world around us.
Moreover, with enough examples, we can train a tool or a &amp;lsquo;machine&amp;rsquo; to recognize or quantify pretty much anything we want. &amp;lsquo;Beauty&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;Hotdog-ness&amp;rsquo; or the more problematic &amp;lsquo;Criminal-ness&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Sexual orientation&amp;rsquo; can be now measured within a few frames, based on a model, a probability, determined by a set of arbitrarily collected data.</description>

      <description>How does it feel to be an object in a smart home?
As things become smarter and connected, their roles in people&amp;rsquo;s lives are challenged. Things become closer and closer to us, eventually becoming &amp;ldquo;users&amp;rdquo; themselves. How will we understand objects&amp;rsquo; needs and perspectives and potentially design for them?
While designers and companies that deal with smartness and artificial intelligence try merge the gap between human and objects by designing objects and machines that resemble more humans in their form and interaction, we decided to take the opposite approach and create an experience for &amp;lsquo;humans&amp;rsquo; to get closer to feeling and acting like objects.</description>

      <description>Recently we hear a lot about Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks as being a revolutionary way for computers and machines in general to sense and recognize the world around them. Security cameras, home robots and other “intelligent” machines will have to recognize not only us but objects, pets and other inhabitants of our life with a training process that is hidden and done digitally through a generic set of images gathered from the web.</description>

      <title>The White Box</title>

      <description>The white Box is a new concept for a home control system that would be “transparently smart” to its user. In collaboration with Casa Jasmina, the first open-source smart home, we asked ourselves how “smart” can a home be? What kind of smartness are we talking about? Is technology in service of the user or is it becoming the controller of the user?
If you want to make your home “smart”, most solutions in the market come in form of a black box that takes care of everything for you.</description>

      <description>With a growing number of networked and autonomous objects as well as the outbreak of fields such as « the IoT », communication protocols used by connected products are increasingly important as they act as the network’s backbone. Since the end product is « black-boxed » to the user, we often assume that all nodes of a network are equal. But is it?
For example, in a home, two appliances in the same network must be working at the same time, but because of a power shortage, they cannot run in parallel.</description>

      <title>ethical things</title>

      <description>Due to fast-developing technology and its endless promises, autonomous systems are heading increasingly towards complex algorithms aimed at solving situations requiring some form of moral reasoning. Autonomous vehicles and lethal battlefield robots are good examples of such products due to the tremendous complexity of their tasks that they must carry out.
When it comes to discussion around the ethics of machines, the focus is often put on extreme examples (such as the above mentioned projects) where human life and death are involved.</description>

      <description>We think of smart/learning objects as yet not finished entities that can evolve their behaviors by observing, reading and interpreting our habits. They train their algorithms based on deep learning or similar ways to constantly adapt and refine their decisions.
But what if things are not that good at learning after all without some help?
What if in a near future, i could just get a person to train my products better as i do with pets?</description>

      <title>ethical autonomous vehicles</title>

      <description>Many car manufacturers are projecting that by 2025 most cars will operate on driveless systems. While it is valid to think that our roads will be safer as autonomous vehicles replace traditional cars, the unpredictability of real-life situations that involve the complexities of moral and ethical reasoning complicate this assumption.
How can such systems be designed to accommodate the complicatedness of moral and ethical thought processes, especially when human lives are involved?</description>
